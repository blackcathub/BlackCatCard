# Black Cat Card
>`PROJECT 1` for Googles Udacity Android Developement Course

This is my first app ever made in Android Studio and also the initial project requested on the Android Development Scholarship I'm participating in. Its aim was to build a single screen app that's a card for some occasion. I decided to create this simple card for Cats Day :)
----------------------------
I tried really hard to make it universal and look good on all kinds of screens. The main picture stretches to fill the remaining space and bottom images use weights to distribute evenly along the bottom edge of the screen. Also Action Bar is removed and Status Bar is made translucent using a customized style to make the app look smooth.

That's about it but remember it's my first app :)
 Thanks for checking it out!
